shader-cell-automaton
=====================

Cellular automaton simulator prototype, using opengl shaders within QT

Deprecated because Qt does not give any control on vsync and framerate, and also because QtOpenGL classes are too simple.
Project is now used as a way to experiment with OpenGL stuff
